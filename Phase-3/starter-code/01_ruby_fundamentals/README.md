# Ruby Fundamentals - JS ==> Ruby

## Phase 3 at a High level

In Phases 1 and 2, we built a fundamental understanding of how to build out the frontend of a full stack web application. In Phases 3 and 4, we'll be pivoting to focus on building out the backend and connecting the two. At the beginning of this phase, we'll be focusing on Ruby as a language and how we manage data structures a bit differently than the way we did it in JavaScript. 

Here are the high level goals for the phase:
- to give you a sense of Object Oriented Programming and how it differs from functional programming. While we can do OOP in both Ruby and JavaScript, we've focused on functional programming in JavaScript up until this point. We'll be writing more object oriented code in Ruby.
- Understand the role of a database in a web application and how we can design a database that supports the features we want our application to have.
- Create a React application with multiple types of related data and connect to a database backed API built with Object Oriented Ruby code using the Sinatra web framework.
## My Focus as a Lecturer

Over the next few weeks, my goal is to help you all to practice your technical communication skills. One of the most challenging parts of learning to code is learning to adjust the way you speak to an unfamiliar degree of accuracy and precision. Your ability to think programmatically will improve as you practice using terminology to accurately describe what you're doing as you code. I want to help you all add good habits and skills to your toolbox so you are more effective–and happier–problem solvers. So, whenever you go into breakout rooms together, practice using terminology as you communicate rather than sounding out the syntax.

So, for example, if you were describing this code:

```rb
name = "Dakota"
```

instead of:

> name equals quotes Dakota end quote

we would say:

> declare a variable called name and assign its value to the string, Dakota.


## Questions to Carry around with you as you debug your code

- What am I trying to do?
- How do I get feedback about the current behavior?
- How can I explain what's happening now?
- How can I test my explanation?
- If my explanation is correct, what change can I make to get closer to my goal? When I make the change, what result should I get? (After I make the change and run the code) Was my explanation correct/complete?

When you watch professional athletes, you will see many variations of a pre-shot routine. 
- A basketball player before shooting a free-throw
- A runner before the start of a race
- A golfer preparing to tee off
- A batter preparing for the pitcher's windup.

Whatever the example, professional athletes develop a set of behaviors that prepare the mind for the task at hand. Approaching programming in the same way can make it a much more enjoyable experience. As you work with me over the next couple of weeks, one of my goals is to share ideas that you can integrate into your routine to develop solid mind patterns that set you up for success. 

In programming, I see this as a series of questions that you repetitively ask yourself in different situations that move your mind in the directions it needs to go to solve a given type of problem. Reading and talking about code are essential skills for any software engineer. I want to foster as much dialog as possible over the next few weeks, so please engage with each me and with each other to get the most out of the experience :)
